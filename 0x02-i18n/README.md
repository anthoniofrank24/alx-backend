In this directory, I am learning the following **Objectives:**
*1* how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
*2* how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings or request headers
*3* how to localize timestamps

For this, I am using the babel extension in flask and learning some new concepts so I can be able to cover the learning obejctives.
